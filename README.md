# PikaTherapy
Need some Pikachu on your website? Well, that's what this does. Using Giphy's API, it replaces 
the images on any website with a gif! Also has a Pingu mode if you require noots.

I made this as a first attempt to fiddle with the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).
The code isn't the prettiest but it works.

# Installation
An XPI of the latest version is included in the `/dist` folder. Install it like you would any
other addon not directly from Mozilla:
1. Go to 'addons'
2. Click the gear icon
3. Select 'install add-on from file'

# Compatibility
Mozilla Firefox only. Since Chrome implements the browser APIs differently it won't work there for now.
